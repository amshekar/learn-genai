Notes: 
Small Language Models (SLMs), like Phi-2 by Microsoft, are designed to handle specific tasks and can operate on devices with limited processing power, such as mobile devices. They require less training data, have simpler architectures, and are quicker to develop. Given the nature of the task and the device constraints, an SLM like Phi-2 would be a more efficient and practical choice.

Leading organizations that created innovative LMs:

Anthropic (Claude)
Cohere (Command)
Google (Gemini, Gemma)
Meta (Llama)
OpenAI (GPT, DALL-E, DaVinci)
